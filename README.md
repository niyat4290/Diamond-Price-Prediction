Project Description:
The Diamond Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately estimates the price of diamonds based on various attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions (x, y, z). The goal is to assist jewelers, buyers, and sellers in making data-driven decisions by predicting diamond prices based on their physical and qualitative characteristics.
